MY BLOG

When you open that page you are presented with a "My blog title" as well as two buttons, one to go to your blog page and the other is a toggle button for light/dark moed. 
the page includes a form for username, blog title, and blog content input. 
When the form is submitted the blog post data is stored to localStorage.
After it is submitted, you are then redirected to the posts page.
If you miss filling in one of the form inputs you are met with a message that says "Please complete all fields in the form."
On the blogs page, you are presented with a "Personal blog" header as well as a back button and a light/dark mode toggle button.
The back button redirects you to the form page where you can input more blogs.
The light/dark mode button changes the page contents to reflect the selection.
Below that, you are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
When localStorage is viewed you are presented with an object that includes arrays of your saved username, title, and blog content. 
In the footer, there is a link to the developer's portfolio.
